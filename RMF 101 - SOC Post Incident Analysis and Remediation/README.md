🧪 Lab Title  
Week 1 – RMF 101: SOC Post Incident Analysis and Remediation

📅 Date Completed  
June 11, 2025

🎯 Objective / Goal of the Lab

🔍 1. Incident Timeline Analysis
- Analyze security logs to determine the exact timestamp of initial system compromise  
- Identify attack patterns and distinguish between failed attempts and successful exploitation  
- Correlate events across multiple log sources to build a comprehensive incident timeline  
- Extract key forensic evidence including source IPs, payloads, and targeted systems  

🛠️ 2. Vulnerability Identification and Research
- Identify the specific CVE exploited: `CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)`  
- Research vulnerability details using authoritative sources (e.g., NVD)  
- Understand how the vulnerability allows remote code execution  
- Assess system configuration to determine why it was vulnerable  

🧰 3. Security Tool Proficiency
- Use *plunk Enterprise for log investigation and event correlation  
- Build effective search queries to filter through large log volumes  
- Interpret logs from various sources including apps and simulations  
- Use command-line tools for deeper system inspection  

🔧 4. Remediation Implementation
- Evaluate multiple remediation options for Log4Shell  
- Apply chosen remediation: updates, config changes, or system hardening  
- Verify the effectiveness through testing  
- Document the process and justify chosen approach  

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- 🖥️ Virtual Machine  
- 🔎 Splunk Enterprise  
- 💻 Command Line  
- 🌐 Firefox  
- 📝 Notepad  

🧾 What I Did (Lab Summary)
- Reviewed a simulated alert for suspicious activity  
- Investigated log files and network behavior  
- Identified signs of malware infection  
- Documented the incident using a SOC template  
- Applied RMF-based remediation strategies  
- Closed the incident with the proper escalation steps  

📚 What I Learned
I learned how essential Splunk is for tracking and analyzing logs in real time. Taking notes during an investigation is incredibly valuable. I also became more comfortable looking up information when I don’t fully understand something. For example, I researched `CVE-2021-44228` using NIST’s database and used ChatGPT to break it down in beginner terms.

💭 Final Thoughts
This was an amazing and hands-on lab where I learned a key cybersecurity skill. SOC analysts play a critical role in protecting company networks by monitoring and understanding log data. I’m super glad I got to experience what a SOC analyst does and grow my confidence in real-world cybersecurity tools and workflows.

🛡 SOC Post-Incident Analysis Lab – Overview

🧪 Lab Description  
This hands-on cybersecurity lab focuses on post-incident analysis of the critical Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) using a compromised web application environment.  

You’ll take on the role of a SOC analyst to investigate a security incident, analyze logs, build a timeline of the compromise, identify the exploited vulnerability, and implement effective remediation strategies.

🧠 Scenario Background  
Your organization has detected suspicious activity on a **Linux server** running a vulnerable web application.  

Initial alerts suggest the system may have been compromised through **Log4j**, one of the most severe vulnerabilities in recent years.

You are tasked to:

- 🕒 Determine when the compromise occurred  
- 🔓 Identify how the attacker exploited the system  
- 🔧 Decide what remediation steps are necessary to secure the environment

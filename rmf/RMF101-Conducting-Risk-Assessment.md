# 🛡️ Lab: RMF 101 – Conducting Risk Assessment (Corporate Case Study)

## 🎯 Objective
- Apply structured risk assessment methodologies to identify and evaluate security risks  
- Identify and classify organizational assets based on criticality and sensitivity  
- Recognize common threats and vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure  
- Calculate risk levels using both qualitative and quantitative methods  
- Develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies based on organizational priorities  
- Create professional risk assessment documentation

## 🧪 Lab Description
In this hands-on lab, students conduct a **comprehensive risk assessment** for a simulated organization using frameworks such as **NIST SP 800-30** and **ISO 27005**.

Students follow the full risk assessment lifecycle:

1. Establishing context and scope  
2. Identifying and categorizing assets  
3. Identifying threats and vulnerabilities  
4. Assessing likelihood and impact  
5. Calculating risk levels  
6. Developing risk treatment plans  
7. Documenting findings in a formal report

## 👁️ Observations
- The **network diagram** is a critical component in understanding how data flows throughout the organization. It helps identify exposure points and asset interconnections.

---

## 🚨 Vulnerabilities Identified
Some potential weaknesses within the software include:

- 📤 Risk of customer data leakage  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Keylogging attacks capturing user data as it's typed  
- 🔀 Data manipulation: Attackers swapping or altering client information to damage customer profiles  

---

## 🧪 Proof of Concept
Identified risks were documented and analyzed, though this lab focused more on **assessment** than live mitigation.

🛠️ Mitigation Strategy
While the lab didn’t involve executing mitigation steps, I proposed strategies for each risk based on assessment:

- Implement encryption and input validation to reduce data interception  
- Use intrusion detection systems to monitor anomalous behavior  
- Audit data integrity controls to prevent client data manipulation  

📚 Lessons Learned
- **Nmap** is a powerful tool for scanning systems. For example, I used `nmap -sV localhost` to detect open ports on the local machine.
- Using tools like **Excel or spreadsheets** during the assessment is extremely helpful for organizing:
  - Potential threats  
  - Risk levels  
  - Descriptions  
  - Mitigation strategies  

🧰 Tools & Resources Used
- 🐧 Linux  
- 💻 Terminal  
- 📝 Text Editor  
- 📄 Document & Spreadsheet Software (similar to Word and Excel)  

💭 Conclusion
This lab helped me gain hands-on experience in conducting a **realistic risk assessment**. I learned how to use tools like Nmap, structure documentation, and assess risks using both qualitative and quantitative methods. It also reinforced the importance of documentation and attention to detail when evaluating security threats.

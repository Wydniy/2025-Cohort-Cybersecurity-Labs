# 2025-Cohort-Cybersecurity-Labs
Hands-on cybersecurity labs from the 2025 March Cohort Bootcamp, focused on SOC analysis, RMF, blue team and pen testing skills.

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity labs completed during my 6-month Cohort Cybersecurity Bootcamp in 2025. The labs focus on SOC (Security Operations Center) tasks, incident response, RMF (Risk Management Framework), blue team fundamentals, and blue team penetration testing.

Each lab folder includes:
- A summary of the lab objective
- Tools and techniques used
- What I learned
- Challenges I faced
- Screenshots or output (not all)

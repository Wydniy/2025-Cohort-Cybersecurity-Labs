# 2025-Cohort-Cybersecurity-Labs
Hands-on cybersecurity labs from the 2025 March Cohort Bootcamp, focused on SOC analysis, RMF, blue team, and penetration testing skills.

This repository contains labs completed during my 6-month Cohort Cybersecurity Bootcamp in 2025. The labs cover SOC (Security Operations Center) tasks, incident response, RMF (Risk Management Framework), blue team fundamentals, and penetration testing.

Each lab folder includes:
- A summary of the lab objective
- Tools and techniques used
- What I learned
- Challenges I faced
- Screenshots or output (not all labs have screenshots)
